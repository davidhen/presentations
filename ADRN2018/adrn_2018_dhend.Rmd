## Background

\begin{wideitemize}
\item  Validation to inform main thesis project
\item  Social Care Survey (SCS) newly available for data linkage
\item  Cross-sectional
\item  Continuous data from Renfrewshire council 
\end{wideitemize}

## Questions

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> What percentage of the total number of individuals receiving care in each financial year is captured by SCS?
\item<2-> Are there demographic differences in those that are/are not captured by the census?
\item<3-> Are there differences in the intensity and duration of care received by those that are/are not captured by the census?
\item<4-> For those individuals that \textbf{\textit{are}} captured by the census, is the amount of care they receive in the census week representative of the care received throughout the year?
\end{itemize}

## Methods

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Summarise data into \textbf{\textit{packages}} of care. 
\item Descriptive stats
\item Time series
\item \emph{Interim} results
\end{wideitemize}

##Limitations

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Data from one council area only
\item Methods of summarising may be different from those calculated by Renfrewshire
\item Did not account for SEP
\item No longitudinal analysis
\end{wideitemize}

##Summary

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> SCS captured approximately 60\% of all individuals receiving home care 2010-2015
\item<2-> Increase in reablement type care over time - not captured by older versions of SCS
\item<3-> No major demographic differences between those in/not in the census
\item<4-> Individuals that are not identified by the census have marginally higher intensities of care and much shorter total duration of care. 
\item<5-> This is seen more obviously in non-"Mainstream" type packages
\end{itemize}

##Implications

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> The Social Care \emph{Survey} provides a good sample of those receiving home care in each financial year (in the Renfrewshire council area)...
\item<2-> ...but it is cross-sectional
\item<3-> Individuals \textbf{not} in the census are short-term care users.
\item<4-> The weekly hours of home care reported in the census is a fairly accurate representation of care throughout the year
\end{itemize}
