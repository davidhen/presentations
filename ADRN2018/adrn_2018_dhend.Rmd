## Background

\begin{wideitemize}
\item  Validation to inform main thesis project
\item  Social Care Survey (SCS) newly available for data linkage
\item  Cross-sectional
\item  Continuous data from Renfrewshire council 
\end{wideitemize}

## Questions

\begin{itemize}
\item What percentage of the total number of indivudals receiving care in each finanacial year is captured by SCS?
\item Are there demographic differences in those that are/are not captured by the census?
\item Are there differences in the intensity and duration of care received by those that are/are not captured by the census?
\item For those individuals that \textbf{\textit{are}} captured by the census, is the amount of care they receive in the census week representative of the care received throuought the year?
\end{itemize}

## Methods

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Summarise data into \textbf{\textit{packages}} of care. 
\item Descriptive stats
\item Time series
\item \emph{Interim} results
\end{wideitemize}

##Limitations

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Data from one council area only
\item Methods of summarising may be different from those calculated by Renfrewshire
\item Did not account for SEP
\end{wideitemize}

##Conclusion

\begin{itemize}
\item SCS captured between 51\% and 61\% of all indiviudals receving home care 2006-2016
\item Decreasing trend driven by increase in use of "Reablement" type packages
\item This phenomenon not captured by older versions of SCS
\item Individuals that are not identified by the census have marginally higher intensities of care and much shorter total duration of care. 
\item This is seen more obviously in non-"Mainstream" type packages
\item Why is this important for SCS
\end{itemize}
