##Project outline
###Background (b) What we know..

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> There is a strong socioeconomic gradient observed for those with multimorbidity which feeds the inverse care law in primary care services.
\item<2-> MM associated with higher mortality, psychological distress, worse QOL, worse functional status, and increased health care use.
\item<3-> But what about social care?????
\end{itemize}

##Project outline (c) Social Care

>"Social care supports people of all ages with certain physical, cognitive or age-related conditions in carrying out personal care or domestic routines. It helps people to sustain employment in paid or unpaid work, education, learning, leisure and other social support systems. It supports people in building social relationships and participating fully in society." [^1]

##Project outline
### Aims

\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Describe and and compare social inequalities in the use of social care services using linked health and social care data. 
\item<2-> Explore the effects of social care use for those with multimorbidity on;
\begin{itemize}
\item unscheduled health care use
\item mortality
\end{itemize}
\item<3-> Assess the validity of existing administrative data on social care for research purposes. 
\end{itemize}

##Project outline
###Research questions:

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between multimorbidity status and the amount and type of social care use over time? Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Is there an association in the use of social care services, multimorbidity status and unscheduled health care use?
\item Do multimorbidity status and social care use predict mortality?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

##Project outline
###Data sources
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Demographics, Deaths, and SIMD (CHI database and NSS)
\item<1-> Social care survey (Scottish Government)
\item<1-> Prescribing information (ISD)
\item<1-> Unscheduled Care Data Mart (ISD)
\item<1-> SMR01, SMR04, A \& E, and USC LTC diagnoses
\end{itemize}
