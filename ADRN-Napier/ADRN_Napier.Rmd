## Research Questions


In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between multimorbidity status and the amount and type of social care use over time? Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\item Is there an association in the use of social care services, multimorbidity status and unscheduled health care use?
\end{enumerate}

## Background

###Study period 2011-2016

## Modelling

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Logistic regression model applied to each separate year of data
\item Model applied to subsets of individuals with similar linkage rates to population spine
\item Effects reported as Average Partial Effects (APEs)
\item Indicate the marginal effect of each variable on outcome
\end{wideitemize}

###Regression code

`glm(social_care ~ sex*age_grp + simd*meds_grp + age_grp*meds_grp + council*simd, family = binomial())`

##Limitations

\begin{wideitemize}
\item No measure to capture those living alone
\item Variation in linkage rate of SCS to population spine at the local authority level
\item No longitudinal analysis here
\item Untested multimorbidity measure
\end{wideitemize}

##Implications

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Age has the biggest effect on receipt of social care - Multimorbidity also important
\item Females also more likely to receive care, but a lot of the difference seen in overall numbers is accounted for when adjusting for age and multimorbidity
\item After adjusting for age and multimorbidity status, there remains variation in levels of care at the local authority level. Further investigation is warranted.
\item Again, deprivation is shown to to be a driver of service use. The difference in effect between decile 1 and decile 10 is of similar magnitude to the difference between age groups 65-69 and 75-79
\end{wideitemize}
