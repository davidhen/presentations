## Background

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth, height=0.8\textheight, keepaspectratio]{images/3MT_plot.png}

## Aims

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Scope what administrative social care data is available for research in Scotland
\item Create a linked health and social care dataset
\item Assess the effect of multimorbidity and sociodemographic characteristics on social care use
\end{wideitemize}

## Data

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Social Care Survey
\item Renfrewshire council social care data (not linked)
\end{wideitemize}

##Linkage project
###Study period 2011-2016

##Limitations

\begin{wideitemize}
\item No measure to capture those living alone
\item Variation in linkage rate of SCS to population spine at the local authority level
\item No longitudinal analysis here
\item Proxy multimorbidity measure
\end{wideitemize}

##Implications

\begin{wideitemize}
\item Age has the biggest effect on receipt of social care - Multimorbidity also important
\item Females also more likely to receive care, but a lot of the difference seen in overall numbers is accounted for when adjusting for age and multimorbidity
\item After adjusting for age and multimorbidity status, there remains variation in levels of care at the local authority level. Further investigation is warranted.
\end{wideitemize}
